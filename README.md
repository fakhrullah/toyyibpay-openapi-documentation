# Unofficial Toyyibpay Documentation

Based on official [Toyyibpay API Reference](https://toyyibpay.com/apireference/), I created this documentation because the official documentation are showing only PHP example.

Any API should use curl as example, because curl showing most basic way calling API. 

From the basic API documentation programmers can use it as reference to use with any language the prefer such as JavaScript (node.js), PHP, Phyton and others.

So, I hope with this documentation, it will make my job easier to refer and use Toyyibpay API. This is created for own used, but I believe this can help others too. So, I make it public.

## Contribution

You can edit `./src/toyyibpay-openapi/openapi.yml` file directly.
But I recommend installed Stoplight Studio & open directory `./scrc/toyyibpay-openapi` with Stoplight .

Stoplight Studio is easier to use compare than manually writing the openapi.yml directly.
